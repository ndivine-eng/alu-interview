# Minimum Operations

## Description
This project implements a method to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in a specific number of characters in a text file.

## General Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should be documented
- Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Task
### 0. Minimum Operations
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

#### Prototype:
```python
def minOperations(n)
